**MobileBattery Contract**

This Solidity smart contract, `MobileBattery`, is designed to manage the battery status of a mobile device. It tracks the battery percentage and allows for certain actions based on the current battery level.

### Features

1. **Battery Percentage Tracking**: The contract stores the current battery percentage of the mobile device.

2. **Max Charge Setting**: It allows setting a maximum charge limit for the battery.

3. **Event Emission**: An event `BatteryStatusChanged` is emitted when the battery percentage changes.

4. **Status Checking**: Provides a function `checkStatus` to check the battery status. If the battery percentage drops below 20, it advises the user to charge the device.

5. **Response Observation**: There's a function `observeResponse` which can be used to observe the device's response when the battery percentage is critically low. It decreases the brightness and sound if the battery percentage is less than 15.

6. **Max Charge Setting**: It also provides a function `setMaxCharge` to set the maximum charge limit for the battery. This function ensures that the maximum charge limit is less than 90.

### Contract Deployment

This contract can be deployed on a blockchain network supporting Solidity smart contracts, such as Ethereum, using the provided SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT.

### Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract on the desired blockchain network.

2. **Battery Status Checking**: Use the `checkStatus` function to check the battery status. If the battery percentage drops below 20, it's recommended to plug in the device for charging.

3. **Response Observation**: Use the `observeResponse` function to observe the device's response when the battery percentage is critically low.

4. **Max Charge Setting**: If needed, set the maximum charge limit for the battery using the `setMaxCharge` function. Ensure that the provided value is less than 90.
